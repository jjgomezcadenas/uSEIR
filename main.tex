\begin{abstract}
We present a formulation of the SEIR concept that represents the   evolution of an epidemic under the assumption of homogeneity and uniformity of the microscopic parameters: rate of infection, incubation and recovery/removal times. Non-homogeneities in the basic parameters are easily included by integration for arbitrary distributions of incubation and removal times, recovering the classical SEIR model under the assumption of exponential distributions. We compare the solution to these equations, uSEIR, to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases with the uSEIR solution. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the uSEIR equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microscopic simulations. A link to software packages for the numerical solution of the uSEIR equations is provided.

\section{Introduction}

A burgeoning number of papers attempting to model the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic have been published over the last few months.\footnote{See for example, the CMMID repository, \url{https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/}} Among these, a large fraction (\cite{Tang2020, Lin2020, Lopez2020} are just a few examples) are based in more or less complex variants of the classical SEIR (susceptible - infected - recovered/removed) model \cite{Hethcote2000}, which 
assume exponential distributions of incubation and removal times. Real epidemic data do not support however an exponential distribution for these parameters which are usually described by gamma, lognormal or Weibull distributions \cite{Zhang2020, 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020174}.

{It is well-known that these more general distributions are difficult to be captured by
classical compartmental models such as SEIR, which normally treat the incubation and removal times as exponentially
distributed, or as the sum of several exponentially-distributed independent times. On the other hand, there is a vast
literature on the study of non-Markovian stochastic processes to model epidemics with arbitrary distributions
for incubation and removal times.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{stocrev} for a review.}
However, we have not found a simple and concrete formulation of compartmental models for epidemics that
implements general distributions. The goal of this paper is to provide such a formulation, which is also practical from a numerical point of view.}

%It is well-known that 
%It has been recently pointed out that such models fail to describe the %dynamics of the epidemics, given their inability to properly describe the %delay introduced by the incubation time of the disease %\cite{fodor2020integral}. As an alternative to SEIR the authors of %\cite{fodor2020integral} propose integral equation models. 

The starting point is a formulation of the SEIR concept that correctly 
represents the evolution of an epidemic under the assumption of full homogeneity and uniformity of the microscopic parameters, namely: i) number of contacts per unit time, ii) the probability of infection per contact, iii) the incubation time and iv) the recovery/removal time. We will refer to this formulation as uSEIR. We demonstrate that the results of uSEIR describe very well the result of a microscopic Agent Based Model (ABM) simulation with no stochasticity in the model parameters.

Arbitrary distribution of the incubation and removal times can be easily  incorporated into our equations, recovering the classical SEIR equations in the particular case of exponentially-distributed incubation and {removal} times. We also show that the resulting equations can be efficiently solved numerically, and provide appropriate codes and examples (with implementations in the Julia and Python/Cython languages). 

The non-homogenity in the infection rate per unit time is more subtle, because, in the extreme case, it should invalidate the treatment in terms of global S-E-I-R populations. We study two sources of this non-uniformity: inhomegeneity in the probability of infection per contact and inhomogeneity in the number of contacts per individual. The first is modelled with an ABM model with a negative binomial distribution of the probability of infection per contact, the second is modelled with a simulation on a scale-free network. The uSEIR equations represent instead the evolution in which the infection rate per unit time is the average one, independently of the underlying distribution. We observe that the simulations show a significant variance which however amounts mostly to a time-translation. When the different curves of infected individuals are shifted to tune their maxima, all the curves fall on a universal curve correctly reproduced by the uSEIR equations. We analyse the origin of this universality, i.e., independence on initial conditions. It derives from an asymptotic solution of the uSEIR equations, which is found to be a logistic curve whose shape is fixed by the average microscopic parameters. In the case of networks we briefly comment on the effect of clustering on the dynamics of the epidemic. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. In section~\ref{sec:ABM} we briefly describe the agent-based simulations that we will use as benchmark.
In sec.~\ref{sec:useir} we present the uSEIR formulation and study the solutions for uniform microscopic parameters. In section~\ref{sec:titr} we incorporate non-uniformity in the incubation and removal times.  In section~\ref{sec:r} we discuss the non-uniformity in the probability of infection, and discuss the origin of the observed universality principle. In section~\ref{sec:net} we consider propagation on scale-free networks. We conclude in section~\ref{sec:conclu}. 


\mycomment{I have one major objection to the structure of the text. As it stands, it may appear that uSEIR is
built as an attempt to describe the ABMs. This follows from the ABMs being discussed first, and the logical process
for building uSEIR drawing from comparisons to the ABMs results. I would rather discuss uSEIR first (basically,
secs. 3 and 4 without the comparison to the data), then describe the ABMs and how uSEIR matches them (sec. 2 and the
comparisons in secs. 3 and 4), then proceed with secs. 5 and 6 structurally untouched. This is basically
reordering the material and not too much work, and I volunteer for it if Pilar is fed up or has no time;
but we should of course agree to the principles.}


\section{Agent Based Simulations}
\label{sec:ABM}

Agent-based models (ABMs) are microscopic computer simulations based on ``agents'' that can interact with each other, as well as with a computer-defined environment \cite{Hunter2017}. Because agents can make their own decisions in the model based on the rules given to them, ABMs can capture unexpected aggregate phenomena that result from combined individual behaviours in a model. In particular, ABMs can incorporate easily stochastic parameters as well as an heterogeneous population.

In the context of an epidemic, agents have four possible states: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious(I) and Removed (R). Only infectious agents can induce the change of state of another susceptible agent to that of exposed. Each exposed agent necessarily becomes infectious after an incubation time, $t_i$, while each infectious agent remains in this \myreplacement{category}{compartment} during the recovery/removal time, $t_r$. In a real epidemic this time would be the interval of time during which an individual remains infectious. The agent can move to the removed
\myreplacement{category}{compartment} either because it dies, recovers or gets isolated. All these outcomes are equivalent as regards the evolution of the epidemic, which 
 is monitored by the fraction of agents in states $S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)$ at any given time. 

We will consider two types of ABMs. In the first one a number $N$ of individuals progressing through the S-E-I-R \myreplacement{category}{compartments} move in a homogeneous space and get exposed by proximity to infected neighbours with some probability. The number of contacts per unit time of each individual is homogeneous in this case, but the probability of infection in each contact can be taken constant or varied according to some distribution.
The second type of models assumes the evolution  on a network where the agents have a varying number of contacts. 

\subsection{Spatially homogeneous ABM}

We use the MESA package \footnote{\url{https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa}} to simulate the spread of an outbreak in a homogeneous population. The agents in the model are called ''turtles'', following the nomenclature of the NetLogo \footnote{\url{http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml}} software. 
A two-dimensional turtle world is divided in a grid of equal size cells, and inhabited by $N$ turtles. At the initial time the turtles occupy a randomly chosen cell and  at each clock tick they do a random move to a neighbouring cells or stay in the same one. 

To simulate the evolution of an epidemics, a small number of turtles are infectious , $I_0$, at the initial time, while $S_0 = N-I_0$ are susceptible. At each clock tick infectious (I) turtles have a probability of exposing any susceptible (S) turtle they find in their neighbourhood. Two turtles are considered neighbours if they share the same cell or are in  neighbouring ones. 

The probability for an infectious turtle to expose a susceptible neighbour can be related to the basic reproductive number, $R_0$,  defined as the average number of exposed turtles that any infected turtle realises during its period of infectiousness, $t_r$, in a fully susceptible population: 
\begin{equation}
R_0 = c \times p \times t_r,
\label{eq:r0cptr}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the average number of neighbours or contacts per unit time, $p$ the infection probability per contact, and $t_r$ measures the time of infectiousness. 

The average number of contacts can be always found by running the simulation without infected turtles. For the rules described before, and in the case of a turtle world homogeneous population, $c$ is simply:
\begin{equation}
c = 9 \frac{N}{A}-1,
\end{equation}
%
where $A$ is the total number of grid cells in the turtle world and 9 is the number of  neighbouring cells of any given cell (including itself). Therefore, the infection probability can be obtained from a desired $R_0$  as:
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{R_0}{c \cdot t_r}.
\end{equation}
At each step a random number is thrown for each susceptible neighbour of an infected turtle, $i$. If the random number is smaller than $p$, the turtle becomes exposed and the clock time of this event is recorded, $t_{s\rightarrow e}^{(i)}$. At each tick all the exposed turtles are examined and eventually turned into infectious when 
$t - t^{(i)}_{s\rightarrow e} > t_i$, where $t$ is the time measure by the world's clock and $t_i$ corresponds to the incubation time. Again, the time at which the transition to infectious happens is recorded, $t^{(i)}_{e\rightarrow i}$, and the turtle remains infectious until $t - t^{(i)}_{e\rightarrow i} > t_r$, in which case becomes recovered (or removed).
Notice that the simulation allows the use of uniform or stochastic parameters indistinctly. In the stochastic case each turtle has its own $t_i, t_r$ which are thrown according to a specified distribution (exponential, gamma, Weibull, etc). To make the infection probability stochastic, $p$ is sampled from a suitable distribution (Poisson, gamma, negative binomial, etc.) \footnote{\myreplacement{The code can be downloaded from}{See Appendix~A for details and links to public repositories for the code.}}.

\mycomment{Using the superscript ``$(i)$'' may be quite confusing with $t_i$. The same applies to the subcompartments
in uSEIR below ($S_i,E_i,\ldots$). We should change this in both cases by, say, $k$.}


The simulation is run for a number of steps that is typically chosen to be large compared with the ``infection time units'', e.g., if the infection time is measured in days each simulation tick may be $1/5$ to $1/10$ of a day. At each step the software records the turtles in each \myreplacement{category}{compartment} and thus provides (in the limit of small clock ticks) the functions $S(t), E(t), I(t)$ and $R(t)$, which can be directly compared with the predictions of the solutions of the SEIR differential equation models.

\subsection{ABM on networks}

A non-uniform number of contacts per agent in the population can be described via the evolution of the epidemic on a network with variable topology \cite{Albert_2002}. The spread of epidemics on networks is an area of intense research, see for example \cite{Pastor_Satorras_2015}
for a review. \mycomment{Check and expand refs.}
A network is just a \myreplacement{graph}{non-oriented graph} \(\{G,E\}\)
consisting on
nodes \(G=\{n_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and edges linking two nodes, \(E=\{e_{i,j}\}\). We say that
two nodes \(n_a\) and \(n_b\) are connected if \(e_{ab}\in E\). The number
of edges attached to a node \(n_a\) is called its degree and labelled
\(k_a\).

In the context of the spread of an infectious disease, each node is
an agent, and the edges represent the contacts. Each contact links two agents that can expose each other if one is infectious and the other susceptible. The number of edges is therefore the number of contacts. The spread of the disease emerges from the local interaction between nodes via the edges. More concretely, in each time step, any infected node $i$ selects randomly one the edges attached to it, for example $e_{i,j}$, and infects the adjacent node, $j$, with a uniform probability $p$.
After its \myreplacement{recovery}{removal} time, $t_r$, the agent becomes removed and therefore has potentially exposed up to  
\begin{eqnarray}
R_0 = \langle {\rm Min}(p t_r, k_i)\rangle,
\label{eq:r0aa}
\end{eqnarray}
agents, where $k_i$ is the number of contacts of the infecting agent. 
 
 We could use a different rule for the time evolution, by for example assuming that at each step each infecting agent exposes all its contacts with some probability $p$. In this case we would have
 \begin{eqnarray}
 R_0= p \langle k\rangle t_r. 
 \label{eq:r0jj}
 \end{eqnarray}
These are two different assumptions about the time evolution, which might represent different real situations. The first one would correspond to a case where an agent infects with a constant rate (i.e there are no superspreaders). The second one corresponds to a case where agents have an infecting power proportional to the number of their contacts. A real epidemic is probably somewhere in between.

 There is empirical experience that realistic social networks have some key properties that might be relevant for the rate of spread of an epidemic. \mycomment{add refs}  These networks are scale-free, that is, the distribution of the degree (i.e., the number of contacts per node) is a power law. 
   In such networks the dispersion of the number of contacts is large. Realistic networks have also a large clustering coefficient, which measures the probability that two nodes connected to a third, are also connected among themselves. Intuitively, it is clear that the spread of a disease in a network with large clustering is less efficient, because it is difficult for the infectious agent to jump between clusters.

In our study we will concentrate on a particular one-parameter family of scale-free networks described by Klemm and Eguiluz (KE)
\cite{Klemm_2002}, where the \myreplacement{average local}{average} clustering can be tuned with the free parameter, \(\mu\). More concretely we consider a distribution of $k$ given by
 \begin{eqnarray}
  P(k) = {\langle k \rangle^2 \over 2 k^3},\;\;  k > {\langle k\rangle\over 2}.
  \end{eqnarray}
 Even if two networks share the number of nodes, edges and the degree distribution, they can look very different if the \myreplacement{average}{local} clustering coefficient, $C_i$, is different, with
\begin{eqnarray}
C_i \equiv \frac{2|\{e_{jk}\setminus e_{ji},e_{ki},e_{jk}\in E\}|}{k_i(k_i-1)}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
In Figs.~\ref{fig:networks} we show two networks with equal distribution of $k$ that differ only in the  different clustering properties.

\section{uSEIR formulation}
\label{sec:useir}

A real epidemic is a complex stochastic process that eventually evolves to a regime where there are  large numbers of individuals in the S-E-I-R compartments. In the assumption that the populations in these compartements are homogeneous and maximally mixed, the dynamics of the system should be well described in terms of the global variables  $S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)$, whose time evolution is described by a set of deterministic differential equations \cite{Kermack1927,anderson1992infectious}. 

We first want to derive the set of equations that should describe the dynamics of these variables under the assumption that the incubation and removal times are fixed. The relation between the changes in these variables is essentially fixed by unitarity. On the one hand, each individual must be in one of the S, E, I or R compartments. Therefore the number of  individuals in the population, $N$, is a constant:
\begin{eqnarray}
S(t)+ E(t)+I(t)+R(t) = N.
\end{eqnarray}
Secondly, there must also be a relation between the rates at which these different individuals move from one {compartment} to the next. An infectious process is that in which an infected individual gets in contact with a susceptible one. Let us call $r_{S\rightarrow E}$ the rate of infection per unit time
per infected individual and per susceptible individual. The number of susceptible individuals gets reduced by those that become exposed between $[t, t+dt]$, that is:
\begin{eqnarray}
d S(t) = - r_{S\rightarrow E} I(t) S(t) dt.
\label{eq:basic}
\end{eqnarray}
This is the basic equation that assumes an homogenous and maximally-mixed susceptible and infectious populations, making the treatment of the microscopic process in terms of global variables possible. It 
 constitutes the simplest possible form of the force of infection, defined as (minus) the logarithmic derivative of $S$. 
Keeping within the simplest approximation, if the incubation and removal times of all individuals have the same values, we must also have that the individuals that become exposed at time
$t$ are those that move from compartment $S\rightarrow E$  minus those that move from $E\rightarrow I$. But the latter must be the ones that entered the exposed compartment in time $t-t_i$. Therefore we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
d E(t) &=& -d S(t) + d S(t-t_i) \theta(t-t_i) ,\nonumber\\
d I(t) &=& -d S(t-t_i) \theta(t-t_i)+ d S(t-t_i-t_r) \theta(t-t_i-t_r),\label{eqs:cor}\\
d R(t) &=& - d S(t - t_i - t_r) \theta(t-t_i-t_r).\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The initial conditions to these equations start with a fixed $N$ and a number of infected individuals at time $t=0$, $I(0)= I_0$, so that $S(0)=S_0 = N-I_0$, while $E(0)=0$ and $R(0)=0$.
In the  equations above, the number of initially infected individuals does not recover, but we can easily force this with the substitution in eq.~(\ref{eq:basic}):
\begin{eqnarray}
I(t) \rightarrow \tilde{I}(t) \equiv I(t) - I(0) \theta(t-t_r).
\end{eqnarray}

These equations depend only on three variables, namely $r_{S\rightarrow E}$, $t_i$ and $t_r$, which in principle are the same parameters appearing in the classical SEIR models. In terms of the 
basic reproduction number, $R_0$, $r_{S\rightarrow E}$ corresponds to the combination:
\begin{eqnarray}
r_{S\rightarrow E} = {R_0\over N t_r}.
\end{eqnarray}

Note that $R_0$ is proportional to $t_r$, while $r_{S\rightarrow E}$ is indepedent of $t_r$. In a microscopic description of the infected process as in the ABM simulations, the rate is related to the microscopic parameters via $R_0$ from eqs.~(\ref{eq:r0cptr}), (\ref{eq:r0aa}) or (\ref{eq:r0jj}) for the different ABMs.

  We can compare the uSEIR and classical SEIR solutions to the ABMs simulations, matching the basic microscopic parameters. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:fixed} we show the curve for the fraction of infected individuals as a function of time measured from 10 independent turtle simulations in a population of $10^4$ agents with a fraction of infectious agents of $10^{-3}$ at $t=0$, and assuming fixed parameters $t_i$, $t_r$ and $r_{S\rightarrow E}$ for all the agents. The uSEIR solution agrees very well with the simulations, while the classical SEIR predicts a wider and less pronounced peak.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{fixedraw.pdf}
  \caption{ Curve of the infected individuals as a function of time for the uSEIR (solid-black), minimal SEIR (dashed-red) and 10 agent simulations (cyan) in a  population of $N=10^4$ and $I(0)=10$ with $R_0=3.5$, $t_i=5.5$ and $t_r=6.5$. Time units are days. The values of $R_0, t_i$ and $t_r$ are in the typical range of those used to describe the
  current COVID-19 pandemic. \mycomment{Poner que una Erlang lo haría mejor en la caption me parece excesivo}}
  \label{fig:fixed}
   \end{figure}

  This is of course not surprising, since classical SEIR is known to be valid when  $t_i$ and $t_r$
are exponentially distributed, corresponding to an underlying Markovian stochastic process. \mycomment{Modifications of SEIR equations adding more compartments can be designed to represent  Erlang distributions,  that for sufficiently large $n$  are narrower, but uSEIR gets the uniform limit directly and without these complications. }

In  realistic cases, not all individuals have the same incubation or removal times, and certainly not all individuals have the same number of contacts and probability of infection per contact. In the following, we consider the effect of these different non-uniformities.

\section{Non-uniform $t_i$ and $t_r$ }
\label{sec:titr}

Non-uniformities can be incorporated in the uSEIR equations by considering different compartments of individuals. For example, the population divides   into those with different incubation periods, $t_i^{(k)}$, so we have $S_k(t)$ as the susceptible individuals in the $k$-th compartment of incubation time. Each compartment follows its usual progression $S_k\rightarrow E_k \rightarrow I_k \rightarrow R_k$, but the important point to notice is that a given susceptible individual in compartment $k$ becomes an exposed individual in the same compartment $k$, but can get infected from any infectious individual in any other compartment. If we assume that the capability to infect per unit time is independent on the compartment, the number of susceptible individuals in compartment $k$ changes as they become exposed according to:
\begin{eqnarray}
d S_k(t) = - r_{S\rightarrow E} \tilde{I}(t) S_k(t) dt.
\end{eqnarray}
while eqs.~(\ref{eqs:cor}) will still be valid for the exposed, infected and recovered in each compartment $k$, taking the incubation period as that corresponding to this compartment, $t^{(k)}$.

Summing over all the compartments, the first equation leads to:
\begin{eqnarray}
d S(t) = - r_{S\rightarrow E} \tilde{I}(t) S(t) dt,
\end{eqnarray}
while in the others we get
\begin{eqnarray}
d E(t) &=& -d S(t) + \sum_k d S(t-t^{(k)}_i) \theta(t-t^{(k)}_i) ,\nonumber\\
d I(t) &=& \sum_k  \left\{-d S(t-t^{(k)}_i) \theta(t-t^{(k)}_i)+ d S(t-t^{(k)}_i-t_r) \theta(t-t^{(k)}_i-t_r)\right\},\nonumber\\
d R(t) &=& \sum_k \left\{- d S(t - t^{(k)}_i - t_r) \theta(t-t^{(k)}_i-t_r)\right\}.
\label{eqs:corint}
\end{eqnarray}
Obviously in the limit of $t_i^{(k)}$ varying continuously the sum becomes an integral with the corresponding PDF, $P_E(t_i)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_k  (...) \rightarrow \int dt_i P_E(t_i) (...), \;\;\; \int_0^\infty dt_i P_E(t_i) = 1.
\end{eqnarray}
We can similarly assume sub-compartments for varying $t_r$, with a PDF $P_I(t_r)$, and the modification would be analogous, resulting in the following delay integro-differential equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
d S(t) &=& - r_{S\rightarrow E} \tilde{I}(t) S(t) dt,\nonumber\\
d E(t) &=& -d S(t) + \int_0^{t} dt_i ~d S(t-t_i) P_E(t_i) ,\nonumber\\
d I(t) &=& -\int_0^{t} dt_i  ~d S(t-t_i) P_E(t_i) + \int_0^{t} d t_i \int_0^{t-t_i} dt_r~ dS(t-t_i-t_r) P_E(t_i) P_I(t_r),\nonumber\\
d R(t) &=& -\int_0^{t} d t_i \int_0^{t-t_i} dt_r~ dS(t-t_i-t_r) P_E(t_i) P_I(t_r).
\label{eqs:useirint}
\end{eqnarray}
We refer to eqs.~(\ref{eqs:useirint}) and (\ref{eqs:cor}) indistinctively as uSEIR.

A simple and efficient algorithm to solve these equations, complete with easy-to-use codes in Python and Julia, is described in Appendix A.




\subsection{Recovering classical SEIR}

In the case where the probabilities are exponential, the integro-differential equations can be reduced to regular differential ones, of the classical SEIR type.

 Let us assume
\begin{eqnarray}
P_E(t_i) = {1\over \langle t_i\rangle} e^{-t_i/\langle t_i\rangle},
\end{eqnarray}
and define
\begin{eqnarray}
f(t) &\equiv& \int_0^t dt_i P(t_i)  S'(t-t_i) = \int_0^t dz P(t-z) S'(z).
\end{eqnarray}
The derivative of this function is related to that of $E(t)$, using eq.~(\ref{eqs:corint}),
\begin{eqnarray}
f'(t)  = - {1\over \langle t_i\rangle} {dE\over d t}(t),
\end{eqnarray}
so up to a constant
\begin{eqnarray}
f(t) = -{E(t)\over \langle t_i\rangle} +C.
\end{eqnarray}
Since $f(0) = E(0) =0$, the constant must vanish and the equations reduce to:
\begin{eqnarray}
{d S\over dt} &=& - r_{S\rightarrow E} \tilde{I}(t) S(t),\nonumber\\
{d E\over dt} &=& -{d S\over d t} - {1 \over \langle t_i\rangle} E(t) ,\nonumber\\
{d I\over dt} &=& {1 \over \langle t_i\rangle} E(t) -{1\over \langle t_i\rangle} E(t-t_r) \theta(t-t_r),\nonumber\\
{d R\over d t} &=&  {1\over  \langle t_i\rangle} E(t-t_r) \theta(t-t_r).
\end{eqnarray}
If we also add an exponential distribution for the removal time we need the function
\begin{eqnarray}
g(t) \equiv {1\over \langle t_i\rangle } \int_0^t dt_r P_I(t_r) E(t-t_r),
\end{eqnarray}
which for an exponential with average $\langle t_r\rangle$ satisfies
\begin{eqnarray}
g'(t) =  {I'(t)\over \langle t_r \rangle},
\end{eqnarray}
and therefore
\begin{eqnarray}
g(t) = {I(t)\over \langle t_r \rangle} + C',
\end{eqnarray}
where $C'= -I(0)/\langle t_r \rangle$.
Finally we also need to average over $t_r$ in the right-hand side of the first equation because the function $\tilde{I}$ depends on $t_r$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\int d t_r P_I(t_r) \tilde{I}(t) = I(t) - I(0) \left(1- e^{-t/\langle t_r\rangle}  \right) \equiv \bar{I}(t).
\end{eqnarray}
Finally the equations are:
\begin{eqnarray}
{d S\over dt} &=& - r_{S\rightarrow E} \bar{I}(t) S(t),\nonumber\\
{d E\over dt} &=& -{d S\over d t} -{1 \over \langle t_i\rangle} E(t) ,\nonumber\\
{d I\over dt} &=& {1 \over \langle t_i\rangle} E(t) - {1\over  \langle t_r \rangle} (I(t) -I(0)),\nonumber\\
{d R\over d t} &=&  {1\over  \langle t_r\rangle} (I(t)-I(0)),\nonumber\\
\label{eqs:seirexp}
\end{eqnarray}
which up to the $I(0)$ terms, are the classical SEIR equations. If $I(0)$ is very small, these extra terms can  be neglected. \mycomment{This comment here is very tricky, because $I(0)$ is what determines the position of the peak,
which has a role later. I think it would be easiest to write the full equations here, which we have. Answer: the question is in these I(0) terms are there in the usual SEIR equations, are they ?}

We can incorporate easily  the exponential distributions for $t_i$ and $t_r$ in the ABMs simulations, while we maintain the rate of infection constant. 
The comparison of the SEIR solution of eqs.~(\ref{eqs:seirexp}) and the homogeneous ABM simulation with exponentially distributed $t_i$ and $t_r$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp}. The agreement as expected is good, even if the variance is much larger than in the fixed-parameters case. In fact, an interesting observation is that most of the observed variance 
of the outbreaks is a simple time translation. If we time-translate all the outbreaks to make their maxima coincide the variance is much smaller and the agreement with SEIR better, see Fig.~\ref{fig:expshift}. We will discuss the origin of this time-shift in the following section.

   \end{figure}

 An exponential distribution for the incubation and removal times is however not realistic. A more realistic distribution seems to be, e.g., a general gamma distribution, $\Gamma[k,\theta]$. 
For the COVID-19 epidemic, the distribution of incubation times has been shown to be well described with a gamma with parameters $(k,\theta) \simeq (5.8, 0.948)$ \cite{Hellewell2020}, corresponding to an average $\langle t_i\rangle \simeq 5.5$ days. For the removal time, we assume the same distribution with parameters $(6.5,1)$. This corresponds to the average between the ``short'' and ``long'' removal times discussed in \cite{Hellewell2020}.

We compare the results of the gamma-distributed ABM simulations in Fig.~\ref{fig:expvsgamma}. As expected, classical SEIR does not give a good description of the simulations in this case, while solving the integro-differential eqs.~(\ref{eqs:corint}) does.

The simulations have been time-shifted so that their maxima coincide.

  \label{fig:expvsgamma}
   \end{figure}
   
We note that, although there is a vast literature on incorporating arbitrary distributions for $t_i$ and $t_r$
in stochastic approaches to the propagation of epidemics (see, e.g., a recent review in~\cite{stocrev}), we have not found {a} simple formulation  of the problem in the context of compartmental models such as the one described by equations eqs.~(\ref{eqs:useirint}).
While generalizations of exponential distributions, such as the Erlang case, are dealt with
in the standard SEIR literature using a superficially similar sub-compartmentation approach,\footnote{See, e.g.,
\cite{Lloyd2001,Lloyd2001b,Wearing2005,Conlan2009,Krylova2013}} this is not quite as general
as the treatment described here.


\section{Non-uniform infection rate and universality }
\label{sec:r}

A different situation is when the rate of infection is non-uniform across the population. It is important to stress that the rate depends on two independent parameters: the number of contacts per infected individual, which critically depends on the clustering properties of the social network,  and the probability of infection per contact. Non-uniformity can originate in either of the two properties. In this section we will consider the simplest case of a uniform number of contacts, but a non-uniform infection probability per contact.

\subsection{Non-uniform rate: the probability of infection}
\label{sec:prob}

We could separate the population in individuals that infect others with different rates. The rate might depend on the type of infectious individual and the type of susceptible individual. Defining $r^{l}_{k}$ to be the rate at which an infected individual of type $l$ infects a susceptible individual of type $k$. The equations in this case are:
\begin{eqnarray}
d S_k(t) &=& - \sum_l r^l_{k}  I_l(t) S_k(t) dt, \nonumber\\
d E_k(t) &=& -d S_k(t) + d S_k(t-t_i) \theta(t-t_i) ,\nonumber\\
d I_k(t) &=& -d S_k(t-t_i) \theta(t-t_i)+ d S_k(t-t_i-t_r) \theta(t-t_i-t_r),\nonumber\\
d R_k(t) &=& - d S_k(t - t_i - t_r) \theta(t-t_i-t_r).\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $t_i$ and $t_r$ might also depend on the compartment.

Assuming that the rates only depend on the type of infecting individual and not on the type of susceptible and, for simplicity $t_i$ and $t_r$ are uniform, only the total number of individuals in each compartment needs to be evolved. This is the case, because the different compartments are in some proportion in the population and we assume the proportion is preserved by
 the initial conditions of the $I_k(0)$ and $S_k(0)$. The equations reduce to the usual ones with a rate that is the weighted average:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 r_{\rm eff} = \sum_k r^k p^k,
 \end{eqnarray}
 where $p^k$ is the proportion of individuals in compartment $k$. In the continuous case
 \begin{eqnarray}
 r_{\rm eff} = \int dr ~r P_R(r),
 \end{eqnarray}
 where $P_R(r)$ is the corresponding PDF. 

 However, this result seems in conflict with the fact non-uniformity in the rate is known to be very important in the evolution of an epidemic\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Keeling2005,Bansal2007}.}. One example of this is the relevance of the fraction of individuals for which the probability of infection is zero, which in practice makes them immune. Their presence in a given population implies that the effective number of useful contacts gets reduced. The fraction of the population with zero infecting power is equivalent to the immune fraction. When this fraction is large enough  the epidemic may be aborted. This is the concept of herd immunity, used to measure the needed number of vaccinations to abort an epidemic. A very rough estimate for the fraction of herd immunity, $f_H$, would be
   \begin{eqnarray}
  R_0 (1- f_H)  =1, \;\; f_H= 1-1/R_0.
   \end{eqnarray}
   For COVID-19, with $R_0 \sim 3$, $f_H \sim 0.7$, that is $70\%$ of the population. {One would then naively expect that in an epidemic where this estimate holds about $70\%$ of the population ends up getting infected; however, in the previous examples a larger fraction is found.} This is because{, due to} the time delay in the process, the fraction of recovered individuals grows slowly and is not effective in reducing the growth of the epidemic sufficiently, as would be the case if the fraction of immune individuals {had been present} from the start, as would be the case, for instance, in a (partially) vaccinated population. Note that in the SEIR paradigm, the immune population is part of the susceptible, that pass by the compartments $E\rightarrow I \rightarrow R$ but have zero infecting power when they are $I$ so they are inert. In practice the evolution of the epidemic would be identical if we just dropped them from the start and readjust the rate not to include them. 
 
  It has been argued that for COVID-19 the distribution of $R_0$ across the population is well described by the negative binomial distribution, NB[0.16,0.0437] \cite{LloydSmithNovember2020}, which has average 3.5 but a large dispersion. This distribution implies that about $60\%$ of the population is immune  (not far from the naive herd immunity), while there must be few individuals that have a very large rate of infection, the famous superspreaders.

  In Fig.~\ref{fig:turtlesraw} shows the evolution of 100 simulations assuming fixed $t_i$ and $t_r$ while $R_0$ is drawn from this negative binomial. The average of those outbreaks as well as the result of
  uSEIR using the average $\langle R_0\rangle$ are also shown. Clearly the variance is huge, and the average is not a good representation of the individual epidemic histories. The uSEIR curve misses completely the outliers.

 \begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{turtlesraw.pdf}
  \caption{ Curve of the fraction of infected individuals as a function time from the average of 100 agent simulations with $R_0$ distributed in the population according to negative binomial (cyan) with $t_i$ and $t_r$ fixed. The average of those histories is the red curve. The simulation has parameters  $N= 2 \times 10^4$ and $I(0)=10$ with $\langle R_0\rangle=3.5$, $t_i=5.5$ and $t_r=6.5$. This is compared to uSEIR (black).}
  \label{fig:turtlesraw}
   \end{figure}
  There is an interesting observation however. If all the curves are time-translated  to make their maxima coincide, they fall in the uSEIR curve, as shown on the right Fig.~\ref{fig:turtlesshift}.
  \begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{turtlesshift.pdf}
  \caption{ The same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:turtlesraw} with the individual ABM simulations time-shifted to keep their maxima invariant and coinciding with maximum of the uSEIR curve.}
  \label{fig:turtlesshift}
   \end{figure}

  This fact can be interpreted as follows. The position of the peak is non-universal, because it depends very sensitively on the initial conditions, in particular on what is the infectious potential of the first infectious agents. Since all epidemics start with a small number of individuals, we cannot invoke the central limit theorem for the initial stages of an outbreak. These stages have a large variability, however as the exponential grows the averaging effect of the population starts to be effective. The curve around the maximum is in fact universal, in the sense that it depends on the average of the basic parameters and not on the initial conditions, as we now show from the uSEIR equations.

  \subsection{Universality and the logistic curve}

   We have observed  that the main effect of the different initial conditions is a temporal shift of the maximum, but the shape or the height of the infection curve does not change significantly. This strongly suggest that the equations have a universal solution. We have indeed found it. Let us  consider the differential eqs.~(\ref{eqs:cor}) near the maximum of the infection curve $t_{\rm max}$, which will remain as a free parameter. Let us also assume that $t_{\rm max} \gg t_i, t_r$, and define the function
 \begin{eqnarray}
 F(t) \equiv S(t) I(t).
 \end{eqnarray}
 The differential equations for the uSEIR with fixed $t_i$ and $t_r$ and for $t\gg t_i, t_r$:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 {d S \over dt}+{d R\over dt} &=& r F(t-t_i - t_r) - r F(t) \simeq -r (t_i+t_r) \left(F'(t)-{t_i+t_r\over 2} F''(t)\right), \nonumber\\
  {d E \over dt} &=& r (F(t) - F(t-t_i))  \simeq r t_i \left(F'(t)-{t_i\over 2} F''(t)\right) , \nonumber\\
   {d I \over dt} &=& r (F(t-t_i) - F(t-t_i-t_r))  \simeq r t_r \left(F'(t) - \left(t_i+{t_r\over 2}\right) F''(t)\right).
 \end{eqnarray}
 which implies
 \begin{eqnarray}
 S(t)+R(t) &=& C - r (t_i + t_r) \left(F(t)-{t_i+t_r\over 2} F'(t)\right), \nonumber\\
   E(t) &=& C' +r t_i \left( F(t)-{t_i\over 2} F'(t)\right), \nonumber\\
   I(t) &=& C'' +r t_r \left(F(t)-\left(t_i+{t_r\over 2}\right) F'(t)\right). \;\;
 \end{eqnarray}
 Since $I(t) \rightarrow 0, E(t)\rightarrow 0, F(t) = S(t) I(t) \rightarrow 0$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$, it follows that $C'=0, C''=0$ and $C= N$.
 Using the previous equations, it is easy to derive a differential equation for $F(t)$, expanding at linear order in $t_i$ and $t_r$:
  \begin{eqnarray}
 F''(t) - {F'(t)^2\over F(t)} + r^2 {t_r\over t_i+{t_r\over 2}} F(t)^2 = 0.
 \end{eqnarray}
 We are interested in the solution near the maximum, so we use the initial conditions:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 F'(t_{\rm max}) = 0, \;\;\; F(t_{\rm max}) = F_0.
 \end{eqnarray}
 This non-linear equation has an analytical solution given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
F(t) = F_0 \large(1 - \tanh^2\left[ a (t-t_{\rm max})\right]\large),
\label{eq:tanh}
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
a\equiv r \sqrt{{t_r F_0\over 2 t_i+t_r}}.
\label{eq:a}
\end{eqnarray}
This is the universal function that drives the evolution of the infected, exposed and susceptible+recovered individuals near the maximum. The maximum of the infected is at $t_{\rm max}-t_i$ for the infected, while the maximum(minimum) for the exposed (susceptible+recovered) is at $t_{\rm max}$. The integral of this function from $[-\infty, \infty]$\footnote{Note that for large $t_{\rm max}$, the range $t<0$} gives a negligible contribution. is
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dt F(t) = {2 F_0 \over a}.
\end{eqnarray}
We can also derive the value of the susceptible at $t_{\rm max}$ since
\begin{eqnarray}
S(t_{\rm max}) = {F(t_{\rm max}) \over I(t_{\rm max})} = {1  \over r t_r},
\end{eqnarray}
and the curve of the susceptible can be easily obtained
\begin{eqnarray}
S(t) = S(t_{\rm max}) - r \int_{t_{\rm max}}^t F(t).
\end{eqnarray}
The total number of susceptible at the end of the epidemic is therefore:
\begin{eqnarray}
S(\infty) = {1\over r t_r } - r {F_0\over a}.
\end{eqnarray}
With this we conclude that the epidemic curve is universal once the value of the maximum position is determined. The value of $F_0$ should also
depend on the basic parameters and not the initial conditions, although
the precise value is not easy to get. A rough estimate can be obtained as follows. Near the maximum, and if the incubation and removal times are sufficiently small, we can approximate that $R(t_{\rm max}) \simeq I(t_{\rm max}) + E(t_{\rm max})$, since the infected and exposed quickly recover; using this and the value of $S(t_{\rm max})$ we can estimate $F_0$ to be
\begin{eqnarray}
F_0 \sim {N-S(t_{\rm max})\over 2 r (t_r +  t_i)}.
\label{eq:rough}
\end{eqnarray}
The only dependence on the initial condition remains in $t_{\rm max}$.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:logistic} we compare the numerical solution to the uSEIR equations to the analytic expression of eq.~(\ref{eq:tanh}), fixing the parameters $F_0$ and $t_{\rm max}$ (the height and the position of the peak) from the numerical solution. Varying the initial conditions, that is the fraction of the number of infected individuals at $t=0$, shifts $t_{\rm max}$, but otherwise leaves the curve invariant. As can be seen, the analytical solution around the peak describes very well the full uSEIR solution. The agreement is better for smaller values of $t_i$ and $t_r$.

  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{logistica.pdf}
  \caption{Comparison of the results from the uSEIR equations for fixed parameters $R_0=2.1$, $t_i=3$ and $t_r=3$, and the analytical result of  eq.~(\ref{eq:tanh}) with the parameters $F_0$ and $t_{\rm max}$ tuned with the height and position of the peak. The two pairs of solid curves correspond to a fraction of infected individuals of $10^{-3}$ and $5\cdot 10^{-4}$. The two dashed lines are the same function shifted in time.}
  \label{fig:logistic}
   \end{figure}

\section{Non-uniform rate in network simulations  }
\label{sec:net}

We now consider the non-homogeneities in the social contacts. 
We have generated a number of KE networks with $\langle k \rangle = 40$ and different clustering properties. On this networks we evolve the epidemic using the time progression explained in section~\ref{sec:net}, that corresponds to a basic reproductive number
\begin{eqnarray}
R_0 \simeq \langle p t_r \rangle,
\end{eqnarray}
for $p t_r \ll \langle k \rangle$.
We take $p=2 \times 10^{-3}$, $t_r= 10^3 u$, $t_i=500 u$ where $u$ are  basic time units, which is equivalent to the number of contacts, since there is one contact per time unit.  For these parameters, $R_0 \simeq 2$. 
This estimate however would only be exact in a maximal-mixed network, as discussed above. In our case, there is a small correction to this  of ${\mathcal O}(1/\langle k\rangle$ that can be estimated more precisely by evaluating the basic reproductive number in the network. 
We can calculate this correction and the result is $R_0 \simeq 1.97$ \mycomment{??}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{uSEIR.pdf}
\caption{Average fraction of infected nodes with time in networks with equal average degree but different clustering properties. The curves are fits  to eq.~(\ref{eq:tanh}), leaving $a$, $I_0$ and $t_{\rm max}$ as free parameters. }
\label{fig:net}
\end{figure}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:net} we show the evolution of infected individuals as a function of time for various networks with different clustering properties. The simulation points correspond to the average of XX \mycomment{number needed here} simulations after a shift of $t_{\rm max}$ to match the position of the maxima, which, as expected, also in this case makes their variance very  small. We observe a clear dependence on the clustering parameter, but nevertheless the data in all cases is extremely well described by  the universal behaviour  derived from uSEIR, eq.~(\ref{eq:tanh}). The lines
are three-parameter fits $(a, I_0, t_{\rm max})$ of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
I(t)= I_0 \left[ 1 - {\rm tanh}^2 \left(a (t-t_{\rm max}) \right)\right].
\label{eq:iasym}
\end{eqnarray}
uSEIR predicts, according to eqs.~(\ref{eq:tanh}) and (\ref{eq:a}),
\begin{eqnarray}
a=  \sqrt{{I_0\over N} { R_0 \over  t_r(2 t_i + t_r)}} \simeq 0.98 10^{-3} u^{-1},
\label{eq:a}
\end{eqnarray}
while 
\begin{eqnarray}
 I_0 = \langle r \rangle t_r F_0 = p t_r {F_0\over N},
 \end{eqnarray}
 and using the rough estimate of eq.~(\ref{eq:rough}), we get $I_0/N \sim 1/6$. 
 Both parameters would therefore be given in terms of the average microscopic parameters. 
 
 \mycomment{I think there is some mismatch here in the notation between using population densities and absolute numbers in the compartments, with factors of $N$ appearing inconsistently. Answer: I dont think so, note eq.(3.5)}

 In Figs.~\ref{fig:aovI0} we show the dependence of
$a \sqrt{I_0/N}^{-1}$ and $I_0/N$, on the average local clustering $\langle C \rangle$. For small clustering we observe that $a \sqrt{I_0/N}^{-1}$ is roughly constant and  matches rather well the microscopic average value of eq.~(\ref{eq:a}). Instead $I_0/N$ decreases with clustering, even for small clustering. This effect can be interpreted as effective suppression of the fraction of susceptible population: clustering seems to screen the access to the susceptible. Note that if we substitute in the uSEIR equations $S$ by $f_c S$, where $f_c$ is the screening factor, the asymptotic solution is as in eq.~(\ref{eq:iasym})
with $I_0 \rightarrow f_c I_0$, while $a \sqrt{I_0/N}^{-1}$ remains invariant. This could explain the behaviour found at small clustering. 

At large clustering, on the other hand, the parameters $I_0$ and $a$ show a non-trivial dependence, not captured by the uSEIR asymptotic solution, although the logistic remains a extremely good description of the time evolution of the infected fraction. It would be interesting to understand this behaviour in terms of some renormalization of the basic parameters
or modifications of the force of infection with respect to the well-mixed approximation yielding
$-S'/S \propto I$.

\mycomment{Here I would also add a comment about the possibility of more general forces of infection, as suggested in the purple text.}

\label{fig:aovI0}
\end{figure}

Note that everything we have studied here assumes no time variation of the basic parameters. In a real epidemic, measures are taken of social distancing, self-protection, etc. that induce a sudden change of the basic parameters, particularly the rate of infection. This effect induces a quench
of the epidemic curves that we have been discussing in this paper. It will be interesting to explore to what extent the evolution after the quenches can be understood in terms of the fundamental parameters, in particular whether the universality near the herd peak translates into some universality of the curve after a quench if it has happened in the asymptotic regime. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclu}



In this paper we have presented a simple formulation, uSEIR,  (eqs.~\ref{eqs:useirint}) of the SEIR modelization of a epidemic outbreak that properly accounts for an arbitrary distribution of incubation and removal times, reducing to classical SEIR in the limit of distributions of the exponential family.  We have compared this model with a series of ABM homogeneous simulations for various scenarios including uniform parameters, as well as various realistic distributions for the incubation and removal times,  for the probability of infection per contact. We have also considered ABM simulations on scale-free networks with varying 
 clustering properties. In all cases, the model reproduced the simulations accurately after a non-universal time-shift. Only in the presence of large local clustering in the distribution of contacts we observed a clear deviation. The uSEIR formulation allowed
us to understand the universality property observed in different outbreaks in the simulations. This derives from an explicit asymptotic solution found for small incubation and removal times in terms of a logistic curve, with a shape that can be determined in terms of the model parameters. This curve is found to fit very well the data  even in cases of large clustering, provided the parameters are left as free fit parameters, suggesting that the dynamics may still be described in terms of global variables but with  screened or renormalized parameters. On the contrary, the early stages of an outbreak  are highly non universal, an aspect that should be carefully taken into account when fitting data and predicting using any SEIR modelling. Only  when the early stages of exponential growth is well underway, is uSEIR expected to be a good description. The averaging of independent outbreaks, without taking into account the non-universal time-shift, can also be very misleading.

\section*{Appendix A: A numerical algorithm for the uSEIR model}
\label{sec:appendix}

The uSEIR equations are delayed and the most efficient way to solve them numerically is to enlarge the number of functions at each time. We define $t_i^{\rm max}=n_i^{\rm max} \epsilon$ and $t_r^{\rm max}=n_r^{\rm max} \epsilon$ as the incubation and removal times, such that for $t_{i,r}> t_{i,r}^{\rm max}$ the distribution probabilities are negligible.
These integers fix the number of additional variables we need to evolve at each time step: $E_1,...,E_{n_i^{\rm max}}$ and $I_1,...,I_{n_r^{\rm max}}$. The variables $E_k(t)$ and $I_k(t)$ measure the number of exposed of infected individuals at time $t$ that will change compartment ($E\rightarrow I$ or $I \rightarrow R$) at time $t+k$.

%The recursive relations for all these variables read:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \texttt{E} compartments:
%\end{itemize}
%\begin{equation}
%E_k(t+\epsilon) = \left \{
%\begin{array}{ll}

  I(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{n_r^{\rm max}} I_k(t). 
  \end{eqnarray}
  and 
  \begin{eqnarray}
  S(t+\epsilon) &=& S(t) - {r\over N} S(t) I(t),\nonumber\\
  R(t+\epsilon) &=& R(t) + I_{1}(t). 
  \end{eqnarray}

Right: the same but assuming that the rate  $R_0$ for $t<t_r$  is the average over the 10 individuals that start the epidemic and for later time the rate turns to the average. }
